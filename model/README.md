![Case model](../images/model.png "Case model")

* `temperature_sensor.FCStd` - FreeCAD case model with boxes for STM32G030, JDY-34 and BME boards;
* `temperature_sensor_body.stl` and `temperature_sensor_cap.stl` - meshes for case. Meshed are ready to import to
slicer.

This model created for development board with STM32G030F6P6 microcontroller, JDY-34 DIP board and BME280 6-PIN board.
All components can be placed in case from bottom to up side:

![Assembly example](../images/assembly.jpg "Wiring example")

Components: STM32G030F6P6 development board in the bottom, JDY-34 board on the top, BME280 sensor board in the left
side.
